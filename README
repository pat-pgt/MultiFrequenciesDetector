Multi audio frequencies detector

It is intended to buil on all enough large FPGA and ASICs

It detects all the 12 notes of N octaves. The edges of the notes are precise. N can be large if the master clock is high.

It is NOT based on the polyphase which requires a linear progression of the frequencies.

The latency is as short as possible, according with the note (short of high frequencies, low for low frequencies).
