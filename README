Multi audio frequencies detector

It is intended to build on every (enough large) FPGA and ASICs as the arithmetic uses serial bit to bit calculations.

It detects all the 12 notes of N octaves. The edges of the notes are precise. N can be large if the master clock is high. Fclk=792.N.SampleRate

It is NOT based on the polyphase which requires a linear progression of the frequencies.

The latency is as short as possible, according to the note (short of high frequencies, long for low frequencies).

This project is in an early stage. The documentation may refer to document not yet written.
