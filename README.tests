The test scripts are mostly VHDL code.

It prevents communication errors between different languages.

The test entity should be started. It exits when done. Some progress information is sent using "report ... severity note". When the test is over, a report is sent by the same way.

The report can be an Ok/NOk or data to be inspected. Especially for a low number of bits, the expected result is never reached. For instance sine2+cosine2 is never exactly equal to 1. The minimum and the maximum are generally computed. A decision accepts or rejects the result.

For high genericity, the test is a set of one parametric test and a generic test to run the first one with many configurations. One can choose according with his activities.
