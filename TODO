Now it looks like I have again some Spartlan6 which I can easily solder. The project resumes.

* The dilemma to write a memory sequencer between the pre-filter and the filter is out.It is time to spend. It is irrelevant in case the FPGA is enough big to include the 2 memories. In the meantime, for smaller FPGA, the PCB is going to implement 2 FPGA with 2 memories.

* Move some entities, such as MultiCordic_LastStage. This stage is never needed as the next step in the process requires serial data as well.
  It should go into a test file. A compare module (and result summary) should be added.

* Replace the full serial data, adding one bit at a time by a serial parallel mix. For a usage in an ASIC or FPGA that have a higher frequency limit, it can reduce the propagation time. The choice has to be done against the carry propagation delay in the adders.

* Investigate to multiply by 2^N the small numbers (both sine and cosine) and cary the exponent. This is not to help the final result as it would have consume more resources. This is to avoid rounding effects. The multiplication is only relevant after the filtering as it works only with fixed numbers.
